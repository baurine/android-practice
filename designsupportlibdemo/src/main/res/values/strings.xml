    <string name="article_content">At the moment I believe that there is no any Android Developer who does not know about Material Design anymore since it officially becomes a design philosophy by shaking the world of design in passed year.

Surprisingly that it was not easy to implement Material Design in android application because those Material Design\'s UI Component like Floating Action Button (FAB) was not available in Android pre-Lollipop. Only choice we had was to use 3rd party library published by indie android developer out there.

Here comes a good news. Last week during Google I/O 2015 event, Google announced the most excited support library within year named Android Design Support Library providing a bunch of useful Material Design UI Components in a single library. Let me use this chance to describe to you one by one how to use each of them through this article.</string>
